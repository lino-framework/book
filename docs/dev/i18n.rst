Internationalization
====================

An introduction to translatable strings.


>>> from lino import startup
>>> startup('lino_book.projects.docs.settings.demo')
>>> from lino.api.shell import *

Django uses the gettext system for providing internationalization.

In your application code, you import Django's :func:`ugettext`
function (usually aliased as :func:`_`) and call it on any string that
you want the user to see in their language.

>>> from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _

If no language is activated, :func:`ugettext` just returns the English
text:

>>> print(_("January"))
January

In Lino we usually use the :func:`translation.override` context when
we want to translate:

>>> from django.utils import translation
>>> with translation.override('fr'):
...     print(_("January"))
janvier

How does the :func:`ugettext` function know that "January" is
"janvier" in French? See :cmd:`inv mm`.

Note that :func:`ugettext` will do the lookup in-place. The following
code prints English and not German:

>>> s = _("January")
>>> with translation.override('de'):
...     print(s)
January

But Django has a lazy version of :func:`ugettext`

>>> from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
>>> s = _("January")
>>> with translation.override('de'):
...     print(str(s))
Januar

This is also the version you get when you say::

  from lino.api import _

A lazy translation returned by :func:`ugettext_lazy` is actually not a string,
it is rather an object that *will* be translated when needed.

>>> from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy
>>> from django.utils.translation import ugettext

>>> ugettext("January").__class__
<class 'str'>
>>> ugettext_lazy("January").__class__
<class 'django.utils.functional.lazy.<locals>.__proxy__'>
