Lino is the successor for TIM.


The history of Lino starts in 1992 with TIM, a DOS-based framework used to
write customized database applications for small enterprises.
TIM was written by Luc Saffre for PAC Systems as copyright holder.

Allthough TIM is almost 25 years old, it continues to return enough money for
maintaining it and giving professional support to its users.  TIM users have
relatively wide-spread profiles, ranging from the independant craftsman who
writes 50 invoices per year to the government agency with 30 users and hundreds
of documents per day.

Luc has been working on writing a successor for TIM **since 1996**.  He has
done and dropped projects in C++, PHP and Java.

PAC Systems changed their name to AbAKUS in 2003(?).

Since **August 2004** Luc is mostly working in Python. In **March 2009** he
discovered *Django* whose database model and application server concepts seem
ideal for Lino. In **August 2009** he started to use the *ExtJS* Javascript
framework. In **August 2013** he published a first version of Lino on
`Sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/p/lino/news/>`_ .

The first real-world Lino application went into production in a Belgian *Public
Centre for Social Welfare* (PCSW) in **January 2011**.  In **August 2012** he
forked "Lino Welfare" out of the Lino core it into a separate project
:ref:`welfare` in order to make it maintainable by an independant organization.

In **September 2012** he registered the domain name `lino-framework.org`.

The second real-world Lino application started :doc:`in Czechia <joe>` in
**July 2013**.

In **March 2014** we started the third Lino production site, a second
:ref:`welfare`.

In **December 2015** Lino got a second developer to assist Luc: `Hamza Khchine
<https://github.com/khchine5>`__ started working for Lino as a freelancer.

The :ref:`voga` project started in **January 2016**, thanks to Alexa
who worked as a volunteer analyst almost full-time during eight
months.

From **April to November 2016**, Annalisa and Johannes gave much of
their time for the :ref:`care` project.

From **January to May 2017**, Tanel worked for Lino as project manager
for :ref:`vilma`.

In **February 2017** `Tonis <https://github.com/CylonOven>`__ started
working for Lino as the second full-time core developer.

In **December 2016** we started the :ref:`avanti` project.
  
In **May 2017** we started to work on :ref:`tera`.

In **June 2018** we started to work on :ref:`presto`.

In **November 2018** Thierry fell in love with Lino and started to help us with
the sales work.
