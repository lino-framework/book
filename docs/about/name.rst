About the name "Lino"
=====================

Lino (pronounced "Leeno") is a common Italian forename whose most
famous bearer was probably `Lino Ventura
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lino_Ventura>`_.

Yes, we wanted **a human name** for our framework.
Lino makes it possible to write complex applications that are like 
children: they grow day by day, 
giving parental joy to those who collaborate to their development.

"Lino" is also an acronym of the words **Linked objects**.  Read more
about this in :doc:`/about/values`.

Note that Lino the framework has nothing to do with the `German
company of same name <http://www.lino.de>`_.  We don't feel disturbed
by them and hope that they don't do so either.  We don't have any
motivation to register a trademark or to prevent others from using
that beautiful name.
